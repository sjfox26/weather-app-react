# weather-app-react
I took what I learned from Maximilliam Schwarzmuller's React course on Udemy and applied my knowledge to a fun weather app.  It fetches weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap) and displays both current weather data and a five-day forecast, with searching capabilities.  It was a great way to get practice routing with React-Router, working with Redux, applying middleware for asynchronous actions with redux-thunk, and overall code design with stateful container components and stateless functional components.
